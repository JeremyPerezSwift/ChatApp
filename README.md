# ChatApp

A detailed clone of the Chat App app built with Firebase.

The application is a clone of a real-time messaging app, allowing users to exchange messages, create user profiles, and enjoy a smooth and interactive chat experience. It's ready for publishing on the App Store and boasts an advanced and elegant user interface.

Using Firestore and Swift, this app presents a comprehensive messaging interface and provides users with an in-depth understanding of Swift 5 & Xcode 11. It was designed without the use of storyboards, entirely programmatically, ensuring maximum customization and flexibility.

The structure of this application is based on the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, offering a clear and efficient organization of the code. Moreover, the app delivers advanced user interface design features, as well as backend engineering expertise.

Users can register and authenticate through Firebase, ensuring secure and reliable integration. Interaction with the database, whether for reading or writing data, is smooth and efficient. Additionally, the app allows for real-time monitoring of database events, image uploads to Firebase, and structuring data for optimal performance.

The user interface development is advanced, integrating deep skills in UITableView and UICollectionView, along with advanced mastery of Swift architectural techniques and models. The app also supports the programmatic building of views and controllers, handling incoming JSON data, and using CocoaTouch classes, UIKit, UserNotifications, among others.

To ensure modularity and code reusability, the application utilizes CocoaPods and custom third-party APIs, implements protocols, creates custom subclasses, and provides extensions and functions for clean and reusable code.
